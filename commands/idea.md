Capture a side project idea.

**File location:** `life/ideas.md` (relative to current working directory)

## Instructions

1. Take whatever the user says and capture it immediately
2. Append to `life/ideas.md` under the appropriate section
3. Format: `- [ ] [Idea] (captured YYYY-MM-DD)`
4. Include any details they mentioned as sub-bullets
5. Confirm with one line: "Captured to ideas.md"

Keep it fast. Don't ask clarifying questions unless the idea is completely unclear.

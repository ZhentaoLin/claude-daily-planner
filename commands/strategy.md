Strategic planning session for big picture thinking and roadmap review.

Use this command to zoom out and think about priorities, roadmap, and overall direction. Not time-bound - use whenever you need strategic clarity.

## Workflow

1. **Read all context silently**
   - Daily files from last 2 weeks
   - backlog.md
   - roadmap.md
   - Any referenced docs (design docs, plans, etc.)

2. **Analyze patterns and synthesize**
   - What's been happening lately (which themes/projects are active)
   - What's been repeatedly deferred (is it wrong priority? should it be dropped?)
   - Roadmap status (what's moving, what's stuck, what's blocked)
   - Side project energy (what's pulling at you outside of roadmap)
   - Time allocation patterns (balanced? too much context switching?)

3. **Present strategic view**
   - Start with "Last X weeks patterns:"
   - Show roadmap status clearly
   - Flag items that need decisions (deferred 5+ times, stalled features, etc.)
   - Keep it conversational and open-ended
   - Ask: "What's feeling right/wrong about current priorities?"

4. **Facilitate strategic conversation**
   Questions to explore (not a checklist - adapt to context):
   - Are current priorities still right?
   - What should be added/dropped from roadmap?
   - What needs course correction?
   - What's the focus for next week/month/quarter?
   - Is time allocation working? Too fragmented?
   - Side projects - embrace or defer?
   - Any recurring friction that needs addressing?

5. **Update tracking based on decisions**
   - Edit roadmap.md (add, drop, reprioritize items)
   - Edit backlog.md (remove dropped items, adjust priorities)
   - Update daily file if one exists (capture strategic notes)
   - Preserve context - only change what was explicitly discussed

6. **Summarize decisions**
   - What changed in roadmap/backlog
   - Key strategic decisions made
   - Focus for upcoming period

## Tone
- Strategic and reflective, not tactical
- Help user see patterns they might miss
- Challenge assumptions when appropriate ("This keeps getting deferred - still important?")
- Support tough calls (dropping work, saying no)
- Balance work priorities with side project energy
